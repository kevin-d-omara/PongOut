Note: I completed 1.5 of Unity's "Learn Tutorials":
        - 2D UFO tutorial (9/9)
        - 2D Roguelike tutorial (6/14)
      Thus, certain aspects of my project (i.e. use of ObjectManagers and
      ObjectControllers) were learned/inspired from these tutorials. However, no
      code was explicitly copied or even "reverse-engineered", other than what
      is specified below.

File:   GameManager.cs
Extent: Borrowed singleton pattern code and general idea; modified for own use
