What is PongOut?
==========

PongOut is a hybrid of the two classic games Pong and Breakout.

Instructions:
==========

• Players each control a paddle which moves up and down and a set of bricks. Use
your paddle to deflect the ball towards your opponent. You score a point each
time the ball goes off your opponent's table edge.

• The bricks are your first line of defense from letting the ball off your table
edge. A brick is destroyed each time it is struck by the ball.

• Hint: you can direct the ball's rebound angle based on it's distance from the
center of your paddle. The further away from the center, the wider the rebound
angle.

First to 10 points wins!
