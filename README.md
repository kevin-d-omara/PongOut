What is PongOut?
==========

PongOut is a hybrid between the classics Pong and Breakout, with the added fun of *powerups*!


How to Run
==========

[Download the latest release for your operating system.](https://github.com/kevin-d-omara/PongOut/releases/latest "https://github.com/kevin-d-omara/PongOut/releases/latest") Then unzip the file and enjoy!

Instructions:
==========

• Players each control a paddle which moves up and down and a set of bricks. Use
your paddle to deflect the ball towards your opponent. You score a point each
time the ball goes off your opponent's table edge.

• The bricks are your first line of defense from letting the ball off your table
edge. A brick is destroyed each time it is struck by the ball.

• Powerups are constantly affecting the ball, including:

1. **Rainbow** - ball color is randomized
2. **Jink** - ball dashes up or down
3. **Boost** - ball boosts forward
3. **Retro Boost** - ball boosts in reverse

• Hint: you can direct the ball's rebound angle based on it's distance from the
center of your paddle. The further away from the center, the wider the rebound
angle.

*First to 10 points wins!*
